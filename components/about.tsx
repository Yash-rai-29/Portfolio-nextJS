      <p className="mb-3">
        I graduated with a B.Tech in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Computer Science & Engineering</span> from
        SR Group of Institutions, Jhansi. With a strong foundation in computer
        science, I have specialized in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Data Engineering</span>. My passion lies
        in building scalable data pipelines and working with{" "}

      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        Professionally, I have worked as a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Software Development Engineer Intern</span>{" "}
        at Clarity, where I developed a Customer Data Platform (CDP) web application
        that significantly improved user data management and fraud detection.
        I engineered a real-time big data pipeline using{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Python and Apache Beam</span>, processing
        over 5 million user events daily, and implemented an ETL pipeline to
        reduce data handling costs.

      <p className="mb-3">
        My technical proficiencies include{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Python, SQL, and big data tools</span>{" "}
        such as Apache Beam, Pub/Sub, and Databricks. I am also skilled in
        cloud services, particularly <span className="font-medium">Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</span>, and database systems like BigQuery and Bigtable. My experience spans across
        <span className="font-medium"> developing data solutions</span> that optimize workflows and enhance system performance.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        In addition to my professional expertise, I enjoy exploring new
        technologies and continuously expanding my knowledge. Currently, I am
        looking for opportunities to apply my skills in a{" "}
