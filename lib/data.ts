      "As a Software Development Engineer Intern at Clarity from February 2024 to June 2024, I spearheaded the development of a Customer Data Platform (CDP) web application. This application revolutionized user data management by enhancing the detection of events, payments, and fraudulent activities. Utilizing Python and Apache Beam, I engineered a real-time big data pipeline capable of processing over 5 million user events daily from Pub/Sub to BigQuery and Bigtable. Additionally, I implemented an ETL pipeline that streamlined real-time data processing from Pub/Sub, leveraging Apache Beam to transform and store data in BigQuery, resulting in a 10% reduction in data handling costs.",
